# -r -> recursive
# -P -> progress
# -l -> copy symlinks as symlinks
# -L -> dereference symlinks when copying
# -z -> compress
# -v -> verbose
# -a -> archive
# -q -> quiet
# -i -> --itemize-changes
# -t -> --times
# -c -> --checksum

# --delete -> delete files from destination that are not in source
# --delete-excluded -> delete files that are not to be copied due to exclusion rules
# --bwlimit=4.2m -> limit I/O to 4.2 MB/s
# -e 'ssh -i /path/to/another/key' -> add extra parameters to SSH (here: use a different SSH key)
# --inplace -> update files in place (huge boost in case of very large files!)
# --include='**/foo/bar/*/config' -> include 'config' from all subdirs of any '/foo/bar/' dir
# --exclude='**/foo/bar/*/**' -> exclude all elements that are below any subdir of any '/foo/bar/' dir
# --itemize-changes -> explain the reson of an update (man rsync for details)
# --times -> tells rsync to sync also times (TL;DR this should always be passed unless --size-only is used)
# --size-only -> ignore times - compare sizes only
# --checksum -> use file checksum for matching instead of mod-time+size combo
# --chmod=u+rw -> make sure that the user (owner) has at least R/W perms on the other side, to avoid permissions error when updating
